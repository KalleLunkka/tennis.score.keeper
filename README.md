## Privacy Policy

This application does not collect, store, or share any personal information or user data. It operates entirely locally on your device.

**Permissions:**
- **Wake Lock (`android.permission.WAKE_LOCK`):** This permission is used solely to keep the screen active during gameplay, ensuring an uninterrupted experience. No data is accessed or transmitted through this permission.
- **Notifications (`android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS`):** This permission is used to support "Ongoing Activity" functionality. It allows the app to maintain a persistent notification during active matches, ensuring the game state remains accessible and prevents the system from closing the app prematurely. This is purely a functional requirement for match tracking and involves no data collection.
